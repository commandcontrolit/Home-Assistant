So I'm new to this, but I want to share what I have done so far, because there is always someone new jumping into this home automation stuff, head first!

So, soon I'll be posting all of my Home Assistant configurations. Right now they're a mess. The primary reason is my "new guy" inexperience and lack of understanding - just copying and pasting and hacking away to make things work! :)

Second reason - I run a fairly small home automation system, but it is growing quickly! I also found and love Node-Red! I use Node-Red for all my home automations and my configuration.yaml and other files are only built up enough to use in Node-Red.

Lastly, I'm still learning and I don't always understand much of what I'm doing - just being honest.

But! What I can share right now are my Node-Red flows! Which are easy to share, import and can be used with 2-clicks! This is the only reason I've decided to start a github - to share what I can (cleanly) right now!

So - long story short - as I take the time to learn more, clean things up and sort my configs out, I will share them!

More context details can be found on my blog @ https://diythisautomationthat.wordpress.com/

Thank you!!
